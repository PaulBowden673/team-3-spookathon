## Deployment

For easy deployment on GitHub pages, you will need a GitHub user account and possibly a Gitpod user account. If you wish to make changes to this repository, please follow the GitHub steps first.

### GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It's free to enrol for a user account and I would recommend you have one if you wish to deploy this repository and make changes.

When you have a GitHub account you can simply click on the Fork button on the top right corner. This will clone the Creep House repository for your GitHub account, then you can make any changes you like.

### Gitpod

The site can be edited easily on a Gitpod online workspace, you first register a free user account on http://gitpod.io/, then download the Gitpod extension on your preferred internet browser. On signing up you will be expected to have a GitHub user account.

Once you have the extension on your browser, a green Gitpod button will appear beside this repository in GitHub. For best results fork the repository in your personal account before you open it in Gitpod.

### GitHub Pages

Once you have the completed site in your own repository, you can deploy it to GitHub pages by the following steps.

1. On GitHub, go to the completed site's repository.
2. Click on settings, on the settings page scroll down the **GitHub Pages** section.
3. Under GitHub pages, Select the appropriate branch or folder the index.html is in.
4. Click on **save.** A message should then appear advising the URL of your deployed site.
